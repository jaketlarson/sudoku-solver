# Sudoku Solver
## About
A Java-based Sudoku puzzle solver, using a backtracking algorithm and the concept of depth first search.

The script is hosted on Heroku <a href="http://sudoku-solver-mdl.herokuapp.com/">. The one-page site uses the <a href="http://www.getmdl.io/">Material Design Lite</a> template, based off Google's Material Design concepts.

When the user requests a puzzle to be solved, the JavaScript calls the a PHP file (solver/call_solver.php), which executes the SudokuSolver Java class (solver/SudokuSolver).
